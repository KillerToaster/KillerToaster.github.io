                 Lately, I’ve been working on refining my EBPD pitch, and I’ve realized that Arizona State University and the surrounding areas are the perfect place to test it. There are so many people developing apps to improve productivity and quality of life, which makes it a great environment to practice and adjust my approach. My MVP is designed to help creative writers, and over the years, I’ve built strong connections within the ASU writing community. That gives me plenty of opportunities to test my pitch and see what works.
            </p>
            <p><br>
                 One of the biggest challenges for me is keeping my pitch under five minutes. When I care about something, I can talk about it for hours. It might help to step out of my usual circle and pitch to people I don’t know. If I can hold their attention and explain my idea in a way that makes sense to them, I know I’m making progress.
            </p>
            <p><br>
                 Another thing I’ve been thinking about is how to present my MVP. I’ve heard a lot of advice about not being afraid to show an early, unpolished version of a product. As a software developer, that can be hard to embrace. It is one thing to build a program that works, but if it doesn’t look intuitive, people might not know how to use it. Some software development courses even emphasize appearance over functionality in early prototypes because visuals play a huge role in getting people to engage with a product.
            </p>
            <p><br>
                 For this project, I need to find a balance between functionality, design, and the minimum features needed to make it viable. Software can be tricky in this way because there is no physical object to refine. It can be easy to get caught up in perfecting every detail, so I think it will help to create a task list and sort everything by priority. That way, I can stay focused and avoid getting stuck on things that don’t matter yet.
            </p>
            <p><br>
                 For now, my main goals are to refine the pitch, test it as much as possible, and stay open to feedback. Even if the MVP feels rough in its early stages, the only way to improve it is to put it in front of people and see what happens.
