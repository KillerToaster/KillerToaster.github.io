                The customer archetype is something that software engineering majors, such as myself, and business majors appear to have in common. This concept tells us both the same thing: you have to know who you are selling to and why. This means that in order to have a successful product, one must first have a deep understanding of their target audience.

                <br>This helps me focus my attention on potential users for a venture I am currently developing. I am lucky because I work with the same group of a few dozen writers every week who I can ask investigative questions. For now, I am trying to identify the gripes that these writers have with existing productivity software that is targeted towards them. One of the biggest needs that is not addressed for these writers is having online community for sharing and feedback of drafts. This is something that is difficult to incentivize so many of the writers go without feedback or consistent eyes between drafts.

                <br>Instead of starting with a solution, I am able to focus on a problem that has a potential solution. By asking more questions, I can discover that most of these writers do not have the funds to pay, so someone else needs to be the sponsor of a software solution. I have also found out that these writers are not fans of AI integrations, so I know what not to include.

                <br>Overall, this video has helped me identify key questions I need to ask the people experiencing this problem. After these interviews, I had a much more clear path forward for my venture.
