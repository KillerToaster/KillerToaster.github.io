            <p><br> I find the concept of an MVP fascinating from an engineering perspective. It can be viewed as the most efficient way to get feedback not just from consumers, but also from a boss or manager. I make MVPs all the time for the web design I do! It is a lot of work to over design something your boss doesn't actually want. </p>
            <p><br> I think the MVP is also a good way to get started without having to implement all the features you may have had planned. It is a great way to get something running live! There is no better way to get proof of concept than by getting the most basic version out into the world. If you think about the evolution of big applications like YouTube, it is easy to see that they didn’t come up with all of the best features on their first release.</p>
            <p><br> I think a good understanding of the MVP also helps creators avoid releasing products that have many features that all work poorly instead of a product that has a few solid features instead. Having one feature that functions is better than a dozen that don't. </p>
            <p><br> Another important feature of MVPs that new developers should learn is that it doesn’t have to be perfect! Find the element that is most important to your customer and make sure that that element is the one that performs its best. Sometimes the product has to look its best with non-functioning buttons for a client to get on board while others prefer to see a functioning backend before a visual design. That is to say, remember what is important to your customer when picking the key features for your MVP. </p>
